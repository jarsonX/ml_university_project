# Machine Learning and Data Science post-graduate course, 2022

## About this Project
From March 2022 to January 2023 I attended Machine Learning and Data Science post-graduate course on **University of Economics in Katowice**. This repository includes two projects that I was required to prepare for 'Machine Learning' and 'Natural Language Processing' classes:

1. Predicting Card Application Approval
2. Predicting Spam

I utilised sklearn in-built algorithms, i.e.: Logistic regression, Decision tree and Random forest. I am aware that more advanced algorithms could be used, however I chose those that I am most familiar with.

## Skills demonstrated
- Python programming (including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, nltk, Seaborn)
- Fundamental knowledge of machine learning algorithms
- Clean coding

## Tools utilised
- MS Excel and PowerQuery (for initial data exploration)
- Google Colab

## Datasets
- 'Credit Approval Data Set' available on UCI Machine Learning Repository ([link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval))
- 'SMS Spam Collection Dataset' available on Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download))
